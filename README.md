# Projects

These are projects contained within the [projects subdomain](https://projects.projectimmerse.com), for [Project Immerse LLC](https://www.projectimmerse.com/).

## HTML, CSS & Javascript Tidbits
The projects contained within are mostly lightweight programs, applications & exercises most which are written in HTML, CSS & Javascript. But you can also find some frameworks, libraries & other scripting languages scattered about.

## PHP codes
Some legacy PHP code & modern PHP scattered about, I almost feel like PHP is Javascript's scripting cousin but in the backend world.
