# FizzBuzz
The infamous javascript question often asked in interviews, just in case you're caught off guard - remembering the program itself isn't as useful as understanding underlying concepts embedded in each construct.

For instance, we can break the program into conceptual parts without even diving any deeper than what is already presented to us.

1. For loop
2. Conditional Statements
3. Modulus Operator
4. Concatenation
4. Scope
5. ||, or operator

I think understanding these reusable pieces is much more beneficial than remembering the program line by line - though the sum of its parts does convey a meaningful process.

The Javascript language, upon execution readily provides constructs these processes much adhere too. Thus, the concepts themselves must be clearly understood.
