# Functions

This directory uses the concept of functions as covered in Chapter 3 of "Eloquent Javascript". Functions are like reusable formulas, similar to how addition, subtraction & division works in basic mathematics.

There are many built in "helper" functions found in most programming languages, libraries or modules a programmer can call upon to perform extremely complex computations. However, diving underneath the hood helps us better understand how programs are appropriately structured & the algorithms - protocols & set of instructions necessary to run a program.
