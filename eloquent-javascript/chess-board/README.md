# Chessboard
My favorite board game, so this exercise suits me well. This program takes a little more time understanding in that it introduces nested loops. Not only that, there are other lurking questions like:

1. What are the implications of nested loops?
2. What happens to scope?
3. Though syntactically nuanced, are loops functionally scoped or block scoped?

Because we are dealing with two looped variables upon iteration, I will be breaking this program down into algorithmic parts, at least granular enough to understand what's going on under the hood.
