# Eloquent Javascript

This book is NOT for beginners. Instead, these books is for advanced or those wishing to level up their Javascript skills. 

The exercises here are visually enhanced adaptations extracted from the book ["Eloquent Javascript.", written by Marijn Haverbeke](https://eloquentjavascript.net)

The book, as the title suggests is in of itself eloquently parsed out in digestable sections - one should not rush through, but instead spend quality time with each concept and with each exercise.

That being said, I have decided to capture each exercise in decorative fashion, sprinkling toppings of markup and styling above the eloquent javascript.
