[NPM Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHDhaSSKmB0)

This is a pretty old video from 2017, but I needed a general comprehensive refresher to NPM (Node Package Manager), in about 45 minutes time.

- Node Package Manager
- Pre-installed with Node.js
- Easily install modules/packages on your system

- All about package.json
- Local & global packages
- Dependencies/dev-dependencies
- Commands & shortcuts
- Versioning

### Package.json File

- Manifest file with app info
- Lists dependencies (name & version)
- Specify if versions should be udpated
- Create NPM scripts
- Easily create with "npm init"

### Common Commands

``` npm init ```

``` npm --yes ```

``` npm install lodash --save ```

``` npm uninstall gulp-sass --dev ```
