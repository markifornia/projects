# VueJS Version 3

This VueJS basics SPA (Single Page Application) is covered in this video [Vue.js Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXpIoQ_rT_c)

Presented by [Gwendolyn Faraday](https://github.com/gwenf) on [Free Code Camp](freeCodeCamp.org).

Big thanks to Gwen for creating this roughly 3.5 hour video & covering commonly used directives, events, methods, components & concepts in general. 

#### Directives:
- v-model
- v-if (removing from the DOM)
- v-show (display: none, however more performant)
- v-on (events)
- v-bind
- @click

#### Modifers:
- @keyup.enter
- @keyup.right
- @keyup.prevent.stop

#### Events: 
- @click

#### Curious Questions

1. Why does v-cloak need to be manually added? This should be added to VueJS's base code by default.
