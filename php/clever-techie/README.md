These exercises are based on [Clever Techie's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95RU58kZlbc) Youtube Channel, I've run into a couple times while immersing myself in various PHP related channels. 

While these are dated back to 2016, I found some clarity in how PHP is explained on a basic level for beginners looking to dive into PHP. I think the IDE being used is NETBeans, now we have VisualStudio to help us with syntax and error detection. So this may throw you off since  this is an older video. I still found some nuggets of insight regardless. 

I am not sure where Clever Techie went, but I hope you make more updated videos soon! I also like that Starcraft & a few old school Atari games are referenced in his OOP.
